disbursement-scraper
====================

Made for the #lartutadeldinero hackathon

## Instructions 

Visit the [Miami-Dade disbursement database](http://www.miamidade.gov/transparency/online-checkbook.asp) and make a search, then just paste the contents of the scraper.js into the console.

Then, you have two options, `toJSON()` or `toCSV()`. Guess what they do.

After the scraping is done, the results will be written to the window.

I'll try to expand this later.
